ðŸ“„ Document-Based Q&amp;A Chatbot with Streamlit and LangChain

This project is a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot interface that allows users to ask questions about the content of a text file. 
The system integrates OpenAI's GPT-4o via LangChain, stores document embeddings in Chroma vector DB, and supports conversational memory using Streamlit chat history.
